# Univariate Data Analysis for Categorical and Numerical Data

Welcome to the Univariate Data Analysis Readme! In this document, we'll embark on a journey of exploring and dissecting both categorical and numerical data through the lens of univariate analysis. Univariate analysis is a powerful tool that allows us to uncover patterns, insights, and stories hidden within single variables.

## 1. Introduction

Univariate analysis, at its core, is an exploration of individual variables in isolation. In this readme, we will embark on an exciting adventure of dissecting both categorical and numerical data, peeling back layers to reveal the essence of each variable and the stories they tell.

## 2. Categorical Data

Categorical data brings diversity and flavor to our analysis. Let's delve into the unique ways we can unwrap its insights:
