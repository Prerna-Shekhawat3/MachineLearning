# Bivariate and Multivariate Data Analysis for Categorical and Numerical Data

Bivariate and multivariate analysis are statistical techniques used to explore and analyze relationships between variables in a dataset. These analyses are fundamental in understanding the interactions and patterns within data, making informed decisions, and drawing meaningful insights.

## Bivariate analysis

Bivariate analysis involves the study of relationships between two variables.Bivariate analysis helps identify patterns, trends, and potential cause-and-effect relationships between two variables

## Multivariate analysis

Multivariate analysis involves the simultaneous study of relationships between three or more variables.Multivariate analysis aims to understand the joint effects, dependencies, and interactions among multiple variables.
