Linear regression metrics are used to assess the performance of a linear regression model, which predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. Common metrics include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It calculates the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): It squares the differences, penalizing larger errors more heavily.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a measure in the same units as the target variable.

R-squared (R2): It measures the proportion of variance in the target explained by the model, with higher values indicating better fit.

Adjusted R-squared: It adjusts R2 for the number of predictors, penalizing excessive features.

Coefficient of Determination: Measures how well the regression line fits the data.
